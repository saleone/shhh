# OnMeeting
Quiet! I am on a meeting!

## TODO
- [ ] Read initial state (meeting can be in progress when app has started)
- [ ] Spam prevention
- [ ] Allow clients to set their name (we can see who has the lock)
- [ ] Allow other clients to ask to remove the lock (spam prevention here too)
- [ ] Create meeting queue (meetings can overlap)
- [ ] Live chat
- [ ] Specifing expected meeting duration
